Judging Process
* Our judging panel (https://naturallandscapeawards.com/judges/) is diverse in both geographic representation, cultural representation, and photographic style. We aim to have the most sophisticated, thoughtful, and fair judging system in the industry. You can learn more about it here. 
* Judging begins with pre-screening from our co-founders and one or more judges. In this phase, we will be quickly reviewing entries that clearly won't make it very far in the competition due to glaring technical flaws (such as dust spots, excessively garish editing, etc.). So, be sure to re-check your entries for these issues. Last year, 62% of images made it past this first stage. 
* Once images make it past pre-screening, they will be sent off to our panel of judges for independent scoring and ranking. These scores are then collected and tabulated by us, leaving only the best of the best images for the next round.
* Once images are scored by the entire judging panel, the images with the highest scores OR those that are marked by judges as their favorites are put into a new catalog for us to analyze. Photographers with images in this phase of judging are then asked to provide RAW files to us for rule verification. 
* Once RAW files are collected, we will conduct several live judging sessions where judges have the opportunity to interact with their fellow judges and fight for the images they find most deserving of awards. As you can expect, this is a lot of fun and quite contentious; however, without this phase of judging, we would just end up with a list of photos that were least disliked by the judging panel and not a true representation of the most deserving photographs.

What to expect from us

* We take copyright very seriously. We don't exist to just gather your photos to re-sell or re-use like many other competitions online. You can learn more about this in our Terms & Conditions. 
* We don't solely exist to make money. Our #1 goal is to advance a culture of realism in nature and landscape photography. We do expect to be paid for our time and effort, but this is not a project solely dedicated to make money off the backs of hard-working photographers. We are after-all your peers in that regard!
* We aim to be the most transparent competition on the market. We try hard to communicate how and why certain things are done, and we know we don't always get it right, but we value that transparency over all else. There's simply far too much secrecy in existing competitions, and we aim to change that.

Let us introduce ourselves

NLPA was founded by Tim Parkin, Matt Payne, Alex Nail and Rajesh Jyothiswaran. We are a group of photographers with different approaches and backgrounds. In 2021, we decided to join our passion for realism in nature photography with our various skills in web design, marketing, project management, and coding to forward our shared ideal that there needs to be more celebration of realistic nature photography on the internet.

Tim Parkin is the founder and editor of On Landscape magazine, now in its two hundred and twenty sixth issue. His own photography is a mix of digital and large format film and he also runs a drum scanning business and offers darkroom services for hybrid printing.

Tim joins the Awards after being a judge over twenty times for various competitions, including the UK’s Landscape Photographer of the Year, the International Landscape Photographer of the Year and Environmental Photographer of the Year. He is also a consultant for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year in rule development and image authenticity checking. His background in these competitions has helped to develop the judging process.

Matt Payne is a landscape photographer living in Durango, Colorado, USA. Much of his photography has focused on his life-long goal to climb the one-hundred highest mountains in Colorado which he completed in 2017. Matt is a co-founder of the Nature First Photography Alliance.

Matt hosts a weekly podcast dedicated to landscape photography called “F-Stop Collaborate and Listen,” where he has meaningful conversations with other landscape photographers all over the world. It’s through his podcast that he has heard a range of perspectives on post-processing. His views have gradually moved towards a strong preference for promoting realistic images.

Alex Nail is a landscape photographer with a love of multi-day backpacking in mountainous areas. He is best known for his work in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland, Iceland and the Drakensberg Escarpment of South Africa. He runs adventurous photography workshops usually involving camping in remote locations. He is a qualified Mountain Leader and was awarded a Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society.

Alex joins the Awards as a long-term vocal proponent of realistic landscape photography, engaging in debates in podcasts and online.

Rajesh Jyothiswaran is a landscape photographer based in Texas. His interests range from macro to astrophotography, particularly in rarely photographed places. His photography career began with a love for horticulture and landscaping with Texas native plants. His artistic philosophy is to represent the scene accurately so that the viewer can share the experience. His images have been published in magazines and displayed at several exhibitions including, London’s Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

Rajesh joins the Natural Landscape Photography Awards on the back of entering, and being awarded in, numerous competitions himself. It’s his experience of the competition circuit that has motivated him to create an alternative.
